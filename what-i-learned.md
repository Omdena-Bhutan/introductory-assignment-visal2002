# What I Learned from the GitHub Basics Assignment

## Key Takeaways
- **Git vs GitHub:** I learned that Git is a distributed version control system for tracking code changes, while GitHub is an online platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
- **Repositories:** Repositories are project folders that store files and their revision history. They can be cloned to work locally.
- **Cloning:** Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository, allowing for offline work and syncing changes.
- **Committing and Pushing:** Commits are checkpoints for changes, and pushing uploads them to GitHub for sharing and backup.
- **Branches:** Branches allow for isolated development of features or fixes without affecting the main project.
- **Forks:** Forking lets you copy someone else’s repository to experiment or contribute without impacting the original.
- **Pull Requests:** Pull requests are used to propose and discuss changes before merging them into the main branch.
- **Issues:** Issues help track bugs, tasks, or enhancements in a project.
- **Markdown:** Markdown is used to style files, issues, and pull requests for better readability.
- **Community:** GitHub has a large community, and features like starring, following, and exploring help connect with others.

## What I’m Still Confused About
- The difference between forking and cloning in practical, real-world scenarios.
- Best practices for writing clear and helpful commit messages.
- How to resolve merge conflicts when working with branches and pull requests.

## Experimenting with Markdown
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/)
- `Inline code`
